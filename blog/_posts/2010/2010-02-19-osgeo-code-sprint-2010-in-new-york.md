From tomorrow the [Code Sprint 2010 in New York][1] will take place and [Jeff McKenna][2] and Georepublic are going to "take part". Not really by travelling to New York in person but via IRC and webcam. We want to use the opportunity to work intensively on [pgRouting][3] for a few days,  and to clean up the project page and do some community work.

The idea of a "remote code sprint" came originally from Jeff, who would have liked to attend the event in New York but currently has some work to do at the Osaka City University in Japan with translating Mapserver and OSGeo4W documents.
More news about the remote sprint in the following days.
