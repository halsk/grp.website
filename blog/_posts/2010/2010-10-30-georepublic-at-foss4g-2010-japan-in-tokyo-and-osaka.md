Georepublic will continue the tradition of [pgRouting][6] workshops. In collaboration with Orkney we will offer the latest workshop, so if you're interested in routing with [OpenStreetMap][7] data, want to gain some experience with PostgreSQL and PostGIS, don't forget to sign up and bring your laptop! For people living in [Tokyo][8] the workshop will take place November 2nd in the afternoon, for people around [Osaka][9] come in the early evening of October 8th.

Aside the workshop Georepublic will present [OpenVRP][10] project and a pgRouting Lightning Talk.
When you're going to attend one or even both events, say hello and talk to us! We're looking forward to seeing you there!
