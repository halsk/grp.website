In 2013 [pgRouting][1] was presentated at three FOSS4G events, in [Nottingham][2], [Tokyo][3] and [Osaka][4]. In case you have missed them all, take a look at the presentation slides:

2013 was a very successful year for the [pgRouting][1] project, but we hope 2014 will become even better! 

Therefore we are looking for funding of new features and improvements, such as adding support the super fast [Highway Hierarchies][5] shortest path algorithm or efficient caclulation of [distance matrices][6] for the TSP and VRP solvers.<br/>
Please contact us in case you are interested!
