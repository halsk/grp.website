* All Pairs Shortest Path, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm **NEW**
* Shortest Path A*
* Bi-directional Dijkstra Shortest Path **NEW**
* Bi-directional A* Shortest Path **NEW**
* Shortest Path Dijkstra
* Driving Distance
* K-Shortest Path, Multiple Alternative Paths **NEW**
* K-Dijkstra, One to Many Shortest Path **NEW**
* Traveling Sales Person **NEW Implementation**
* Turn Restriction Shortest Path (TRSP) **NEW**
* New functions for creating routing topology
* New functions for analyzing a graph for problems

<!-- more -->

[pgRouting][2] 2.0 is **not** backwards compatible with the 1.x version. This is a significant overhaul of the whole pgRouting environment and we have renamed all the functions and rationalized the arguments and return types. While this will be a painful migration for 1.x applications, we believe the new functionality, the high quality of the code, and new documentation will make it much easier to grow the product and support it over future releases.
