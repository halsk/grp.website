In September the annual [FOSS4G][1] will take place in Nottingham, and beside being a [sponsor][2] Georepublic will attend the event with three of us travelling from Tokyo and Osaka. We are also planning to attend [State of the Map][5] in Birmingham, UK and the [Quantum GIS Developer Meeting][6] in Brighton before heading to FOSS4G.

![FOSS4G 2013][4]

Our main news for this FOSS4G will be the new major release of [pgRouting][3], which has been partially rewritten, newly structured and comes with a bunch of new algorithms and more.

<!-- more -->

Georepublic already starts with a workshop on Tuesday afternoon. Together with Yves Jacolin and Frederic Junod from [Camptocamp][10] we made this year's pgRouting workshop even better.

Here a list of where you can meet us at the conference:

- pgRouting Workshop (Hal Seki, Yves Jacolin): [FOSS4G routing with pgRouting tools and OpenStreetMap][7] 
- Presentation 1 (Taro Matsuzawa, Ko Nagase): [SVG Map - Tile Map Without Javascript][8]
- Presentation 2 (Hal Seki, Ko Nagase): [Shortest path search for real road networks with pgRouting][9]

We will be around the venue during the conference, the [code sprint][11] and [Geohack][12] event before and after, listening to presentations and talking with other developers. Not to forget the "night program" in the pubs of Nottingham. Come and say "hi" if you see us.
