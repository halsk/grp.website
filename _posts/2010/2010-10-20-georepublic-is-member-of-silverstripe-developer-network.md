Georepublic uses the [SilverStripe CMS][1] for its own company website as well as for several projects. We can say that SilverStripe is our favorite content management system, because it gives us the freedom to efficiently build custom websites with enough flexibility for various needs.

!['SilverStripe CMS'][2]

SilverStripe CMS is easy for both developers and content authors to work with:

- Edit content with ease
- Build it simple or build it complex
- Design freedom
- Get your workflow in order
- Integrate well with open technologies

[Georepublic joined the SilverStripe Developer Network][3] to show our support for this open source project. If you need professional help to build your own CMS, feel free to [contact us][4].
