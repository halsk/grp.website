!['pgRouting Project'][1]

It has been a long way but finally we made it: 
I'm glad to be able to announce the new pgRouting website, that also comes with a lot of other changes and news! I hope the migration doesn’t produce a lot of confusion but makes it easier to participate in the project and make development faster and better!

Here the changes in detail:

## New Website and URL

pgRouting got a new website and URL. So update your bookmarks to <http://www.pgrouting.org>. 
The website is built with Sphinx and hosted on GitHub: <https://github.com/pgRouting/website>.

Old content from the previous TRAC wiki has been reviewed, and if it was seen as useful and not completely outdated, it was copied to the new site. If you want to make changes to the website, contribute content or make corrections, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. Or send an email to <project@pgrouting.org> and we will give you commit rights to the repository.

## New Source Repository

The source repositories moved to GitHub: <https://github.com/pgRouting/>. 
There you can find repositories for pgRouting library itself as well as source code of the project website, osm2pgrouting, the workshop and others. pgRouting repositories are public, but write access is limited. Send an email to <project@pgrouting.org> if you want to make changes to the website or if you want to contribute to the project. 
We hope Git makes it easier to participate in the project and make development faster and collaboration better!

## New Mailing Lists and Forum

For some time already there are two mailing lists for pgRouting, hosted on OSGeo mailing list server:

- User mailing list: <http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/pgrouting-users>
- Developer mailing list: <http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/pgrouting-dev>

The discussion forum is not available anymore for posting questions and we recommend <http://gis.stackexchange.com> instead (we kept a cached copy as a reference). Find all questions tagged with "pgrouting" under <http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pgrouting>

More information: <http://www.pgrouting.org/support.html>

## New Release 1.05

There has been no new release of pgRouting library for a long time, though several bugs have been fixed in the meanwhile. 
Release 1.05 doesn't contain any new features but is a bugfix release and a tag at the time of the migration to GitHub.

## New Fund-Raising

Maybe you have used pgRouting for your research project or for some commercial application or something else. Or maybe you’re planning to use pgRouting for your next project. 

If you would like to support the pgRouting not only through community activity, but also provide some financial support, then feel free to make some donation.

More information: <http://www.pgrouting.org/donate.html>
 
Hoping you enjoy the new website and pgRouting!
