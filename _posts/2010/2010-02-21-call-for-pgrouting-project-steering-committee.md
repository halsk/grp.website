Georepublic made a [call for establishing a Project Steering Committee][1] for [pgRouting][2]. We want to boost project activity and make it easier for others to join and influence pgRouting development. 

Looking at successful OSGeo projects we think that it should become easier to participate for everyone, and decisions should be made more transparent. 

!['pgRouting Project'][4]

We believe that having a PSC would be the initial step for pgRouting to become more "open", to handle project management properly, to improve code quality, to hopefully extend functionality and of course to attract more developers and users.

To start an initial Project Steering Committee we're now looking for candidates. 
Since the number of people who have been involved so far is rather small, we welcome anyone who has strong interest and/or motivation to participate.

If any other individuals/companies are interested, please [raise your voice now][3]!
